Student Record Management System


1) Create a class named "Student" with attributes name (String) , age (int) , grade (double) , phone (String)
   and a constructor to initialize these attributes using named parameter
   
   * Implement a void function to update degree & phone : this function takes two parameters (newGrade & phone)
     and assign these values to the grade and phone (attributes). 
   * Implement a void function to just display the values of the attributes.

2) Make a list called studentRecord of the type Student.


3) Implement a function to add a new student to the system 
   
   * take input for name, age, grade, and phone.
   * make an object and pass these variables to the class by the constructor.
   * add this object to the list using (add) function.

4) Implement a function to update a student's information (change their grade or contact details).
   
   * the function must take the name of the user as an input and search in the list about that user.
   * if the name exists , you can take input for grade & phone and call update function 
     you have done in the class to update these value.

5) Implement a function to search for a student by their name and display their information if found.
   
   * the function must take the name of the user as an input and search in the list about the user.
   * if the name exists , call the display function you have done in the class to display all user information.

6) Delete Student Function: This function allows the user to delete a student from the system by searching for their name.
If the student is found, they are removed from the studentRecord list. If not found, an appropriate message is displayed.
   
   * Prompt the user to enter the name of the student they want to delete. Store the input in searchName.
   * Use removeWhere to filter and remove the student whose name matches searchName. Before deletion, store the initial length of the list (initialLength) to compare later.
   * If the list's length decreases after removeWhere, it means the student was found and deleted. If no change occurs, the student was not found.
   * If deleted: Print "Student deleted successfully!" , If not found: Print "Student not found!"

7) Use a loop to display a menu with options for the user to perform different operations 
   (add a student, update student information , search for a student, exit the system).

   * make while loop with a condition (true) , and take an input from the user as a choice
 
     1. Add a student
     2. Update student information
     3. Search for a student
     4. Display all students
     5. Exit

   use switch case to perform this
